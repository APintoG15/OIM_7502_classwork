# Midterm - AutoViz Automated EDA

This folder contains my midterm project for the **AutoViz** Python library, used for automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

### 📊 Dataset Sources
- **fruitfz.csv** — FAOSTAT Fruits and Agriculture data  
  Source: [FAO.org - FAOSTAT QCL Data](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL)
- **titanic.json** — Sample dataset for JSON data visualization and structure testing.

### 🧠 Project Purpose
The objective of this project is to:
1. Practice automated data visualization using **AutoViz**.  
2. Compare results across CSV and JSON file formats.  
3. Learn how to save and organize plots efficiently for EDA reporting.

### 📂 Folder Contents
- `Programming Midterm – AutoViz Automated EDA.ipynb` — Main analysis notebook  
- `fruitfz.csv` — CSV dataset  
- `titanic.json` — JSON dataset  
- `AutoViz_Plots/` — Folder where generated plots are saved (if applicable)
